# depsview

Lists all dependencies and transitive dependencies of a Python or npm project. For each package it shows the resolved version, release dates, and total number of published versions. All data is fetched live — no local Python or Node.js installation required.

Built with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

**Data sources:** [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) for Python packages, [registry.npmjs.org](https://registry.npmjs.org) for npm packages, [api.github.com](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) for GitHub URL support, [pypistats.org](https://pypistats.org/) for Python download statistics (optional), [socket.dev](https://socket.dev/) for supply chain security scores (optional).

## Requirements

Node.js 18 or later. No third-party dependencies.

## Usage

```bash
node src/main.js <path-to-project|github-url> [options]
```

The ecosystem (Python or npm) is **auto-detected** from the files present. Use `--npm` or `--python` to override when both are present.

```bash
# Auto-detect
node src/main.js ./my-python-project
node src/main.js ./my-node-project
node src/main.js https://github.com/owner/repo

# Explicit ecosystem
node src/main.js ./mixed-repo --npm
node src/main.js ./mixed-repo --python
```

**Example output (npm):**

Results are sorted by release date (newest first). In the web UI and HTML report, click any column header to re-sort — clicking a sorted column toggles ascending/descending.

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--npm` | Force npm ecosystem |
| `--python` | Force Python ecosystem |
| `--include-tests` | Include dev/test dependencies |
| `--json` | Machine-readable JSON output |
| `--download-stats` / `--ds` | Fetch Python download counts from pypistats.org (Python only) |
| `--socket-key=<key>` | Socket.dev API key — enables the Supply Chain column |
| `--socket-org=<slug>` | Socket.dev organisation slug (required with `--socket-key`) |
| `--report[=<file>]` | Write a self-contained HTML report (default: `depsview-report.html`) |
| `--debug` | Print API errors and warnings to stderr |

Both socket flags can also be supplied as environment variables `SOCKET_KEY` and `SOCKET_ORG`; the `--socket-key` / `--socket-org` flags take precedence when both are present.

## npm support

Lock files are always preferred over `package.json`. The priority order is:

1. `package-lock.json` (npm)
2. `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm)
3. `package.json` (fallback — recursive registry resolution)

### package-lock.json

When a `package-lock.json` is present, depsview reads the complete list of installed packages directly from it — no recursive registry traversal needed. Packages flagged `"dev": true` are excluded unless `--include-tests` is passed.

Supports lockfileVersion 1, 2, and 3.

### pnpm-lock.yaml

When a `pnpm-lock.yaml` is present, depsview reads the flat package list from the `packages:` section.

Supports lockfile versions 5, 6, and 9:

| Version | pnpm | Dev-package detection |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | ≤6 | `dev: true` flag inside each entry |
| 6 | 7/8 | `dev: true` flag inside each entry |
| 9 | 9+ | `devDependencies` in the `importers:` section |

### package.json fallback

When no lock file is found, depsview reads `package.json` and recursively resolves all transitive dependencies from the npm registry, following each package's `dependencies` field.

### Scoped packages

Scoped package names (e.g. `@babel/core`, `@types/node`) are fully supported throughout.

### devDependencies

Pass `--include-tests` to include `devDependencies` alongside `dependencies`.

## Python support

### Supported dependency file formats

| File | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pyproject.toml` | PEP 621 `[project] dependencies` or Poetry `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` | Optional deps excluded |
| `manifest.json` | Home Assistant integration manifest | Reads `requirements` array |
| `requirements.txt` | pip requirements format | Supports `-r` file includes |
| `setup.cfg` | `[options] install_requires` | |
| `Pipfile` | Pipenv | Reads `[packages]` only |

All matching files are parsed and merged. When the same package appears in multiple files its version constraints are combined.

### Version constraints

All standard [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) specifiers are supported: `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `!=`, `~=`, and bare package names (resolves to latest stable).

### Download statistics

Pass `--download-stats` (or `--ds`) to also fetch monthly download counts from [pypistats.org](https://pypistats.org/). Disabled by default to avoid rate-limit errors on large projects.

## GitHub URL support

Pass a GitHub repository URL instead of a local path:

```bash
node src/main.js https://github.com/owner/repo
node src/main.js https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/main
node src/main.js https://github.com/owner/repo/tree/main/subfolder
```

Ecosystem is auto-detected from the root directory listing. Python projects are traversed up to two levels deep; npm projects are read from the specified directory only.

**Authentication:** the GitHub API allows 60 unauthenticated requests/hour. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` for private repos or to raise the limit to 5 000/hour:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_... node src/main.js https://github.com/owner/private-repo
```

## Output columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Package | Package name (links to registry page in web UI) |
| Version | Resolved version |
| Released | Date the resolved version was published |
| First Release | Date the package first appeared on its registry |
| Releases | Total number of published versions |
| Downloads/mo | Python only, with `--download-stats` |
| Supply Chain | Score 0–100 % from socket.dev (requires `--socket-key` + `--socket-org`) |
| Link | Registry page URL (CLI only) |

### Color coding (CLI)

| Color | Cell | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Yellow | Released | Version published within the last 7 days |
| Red | First Release | Package first appeared within the last 30 days |
| Green | Supply Chain | Score ≥ 80 % |
| Yellow | Supply Chain | Score 50–79 % |
| Red | Supply Chain | Score < 50 % |

No color codes are emitted when output is piped or redirected.

### JSON output

```bash
node src/main.js <path-or-url> --json
```

```json
[
  {
    "name": "lodash",
    "version": "4.17.21",
    "released": "2021-02-20",
    "firstReleased": "2012-01-13",
    "releases": 116,
    "link": "https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash"
  }
]
```

When `--socket-key` and `--socket-org` are provided, each entry additionally contains:

```json
{
  "supplyChainScore": 0.87
}
```

`supplyChainScore` is `null` when the package was not returned by the socket.dev API.

### HTML report

```bash
node src/main.js <path-or-url> --report                 # writes depsview-report.html
node src/main.js <path-or-url> --report=custom-name.html
```

Generates a self-contained HTML file (all CSS inlined, no external dependencies) that replicates the terminal table with the same dark theme used by the web UI. The report can be opened directly in a browser, attached to a PR, or shared via email. All flags that affect the terminal table (`--download-stats`, `--socket-key`, etc.) are reflected in the report. The `--report` flag can be combined with `--json` — the JSON goes to stdout and the HTML is written to the file.

Every column header is clickable: click once to sort ascending, click again to toggle descending. The default sort is release date descending (newest first). String columns (Package, Version) default to ascending on first click; all other columns (dates, counts, Supply Chain score) default to descending.

## Excluding test dependencies

By default the following are excluded (Python):

- **Test directories** — `test`, `tests`, `testing`, `e2e`, `integration_tests` are not traversed on GitHub.
- **Test requirement files** — `-r` includes matching `test`, `dev`, `lint`, `docs`, `ci` are skipped.
- **Poetry dev-deps** — `[tool.poetry.dev-dependencies]` and group sections.
- **Pipenv dev-packages** — `[dev-packages]` in `Pipfile`.

For npm: `devDependencies` in `package.json` and packages flagged `"dev": true` in the lock file are excluded.

Pass `--include-tests` to disable all filtering.

## Web interface

Open the browser UI with the Go server from the repo root:

```bash
npm run prepare   # creates web/src → src symlink (first time only)
go run server.go
# open http://localhost:8080/web/
go run server.go -port 9000   # custom port
go run server.go -dir ./web   # serve a different directory
```

The web UI supports the same GitHub URL formats as the CLI. It auto-detects the ecosystem and links each package to its registry page (PyPI or npmjs.com). Download statistics are not shown in the web UI because pypistats.org does not support cross-origin (CORS) requests from browsers.

### GitHub token in the web UI

Enter a personal access token in the **GitHub token** field. It is used only for `api.github.com` and never sent elsewhere. Check **Remember token** to persist it in `localStorage`.

### Socket.dev credentials in the web UI

Enter your Socket.dev API key and organisation slug in the **Socket.dev API key** and **Socket.dev org slug** fields. When both are provided, a Supply Chain column is added to the results table with scores colour-coded green (≥ 80 %), amber (50–79 %), or red (< 50 %). Check **Remember Socket.dev credentials** to persist them in `localStorage`.

## Debug mode

```bash
node src/main.js <path-or-url> --debug
```

Debug lines are prefixed with `[debug]` and always go to stderr so they don't interfere with `--json` or piped output.

## Running tests

```bash
npm test
```
